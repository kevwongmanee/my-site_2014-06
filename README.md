# Personal site for Kevin Wongmanee

This is the personal site for Kevin Wongmanee

## What was used

  
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) `gem install compass`
  * [Node](http://nodejs.org) `npm install bower -g`

## Foundation

Instead of grabbing foundation from the site, I grabbed the scss files from the [Foundation Repo](https://github.com/zurb/foundation/tree/master/scss)

# How to get started

## Load dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build dist directory for deployment

Run `grunt build-local` to build a dist directory. These are the final files that will be used.
